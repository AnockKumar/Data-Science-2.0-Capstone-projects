import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# 1. Data Collection
# Gather patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) and medical databases
# Assuming data is stored in an Excel file named 'dataset.xlsx'
patient_data = pd.read_excel(r'C:\Users\Anock\Downloads\dataset.xlsx')

# Ensure data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations
# This might involve handling data encryption and access control, not shown in this code

# 2. Data Preprocessing
# Clean and preprocess the patient data to handle missing values and remove noise
patient_data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Anonymize and encrypt sensitive patient information for security
# This step might involve removing or encrypting personally identifiable information (PII), not shown in this code

# 3. Feature Engineering
# Extract relevant features from the patient data
# Features could include demographics, medical history, diagnostic results, etc.
# For example, let's assume 'SEX' is a categorical variable and 'AGE' is a numerical variable
# Transform categorical variables into numerical representations
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
patient_data['SEX'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(patient_data['SEX'])

# If 'SOURCE' is categorical, you can keep this line, otherwise, remove it
patient_data['SOURCE'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(patient_data['SOURCE'])


# 4. Model Development
# Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest)
# Train the models using the preprocessed patient data
X = patient_data.drop(columns=['SEX'])  # Assuming 'treatment_outcome' is the target variable
y = patient_data['SEX']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 5. Model Interpretability
# Implement methods such as feature importance
feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
# For example, you can print feature importance scores
print("Feature Importance Scores:")
for i, feature in enumerate(X.columns):
    print(f"{feature}: {feature_importances[i]}")

# 6. User Interface
# Design a user-friendly interface that allows doctors to input patient data and receive treatment recommendations
# Ensure data security and confidentiality in the user interface
# This part typically involves building a GUI using frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or web-based technologies

# 7. Model Evaluation
# Evaluate the model's performance using success metrics
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
print(f"Model Precision: {precision}")
