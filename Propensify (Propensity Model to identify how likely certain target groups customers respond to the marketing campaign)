# Step 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
zip_file_path = r"C:\Users\Anock\Downloads\Propensify.zip"
# Extract the ZIP file
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(r"C:\Users\Anock\Downloads\Propensify")

# Load the train data

# Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

# Step 2: Feature Engineering and Selection
# Assuming no feature engineering is required for this basic example

# Step 3: Model Selection and Training
X = train_data.drop(columns=['target_column'])
y = train_data['target_column']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose a classification model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Model Accuracy:", accuracy)

# Step 5: Model Deployment Plan
# Deployment Plan:
# 1. Choose Deployment Platform: Deploy the model as a web service on Heroku.
# 2. Package the trained model along with necessary dependencies.
# 3. Set up the deployment environment on Heroku.
# 4. Deploy the model as an API.
# 5. Monitor the deployed model for performance and scalability.
# 6. Prepare documentation explaining how to use the deployed model and its benefits for the company.
