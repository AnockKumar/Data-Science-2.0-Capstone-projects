# Importing the necessary libraries
import zipfile
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, average_precision_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Step 1: Data Collection
data_path = r"C:\Users\Anock\Downloads\Recommender.zip"
with zipfile.ZipFile(data_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("Recommender_data")

# Load data
product_data = pd.read_csv("Recommender_data/product_data.csv")
customer_profiles = pd.read_csv("Recommender_data/customer_profiles.csv")
purchase_history = pd.read_csv("Recommender_data/purchase_history.csv")
browsing_behavior = pd.read_csv("Recommender_data/browsing_behavior.csv")

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# No missing values observed 

# Step 3: Model Training
# Example:
X = customer_profiles[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3']]  # Features
y = customer_profiles['target_variable']  # Target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model (Example: Random Forest Classifier)
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 4: Evaluation Metrics
# Evaluate performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision
# Example:
def evaluate_recommender_system(model, X_test, y_test):
    # Example evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
    f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)
    avg_precision = average_precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Precision:", precision)
    print("Recall:", recall)
    print("F1-score:", f1)
    print("Average Precision:", avg_precision)

# Evaluation
evaluate_recommender_system(model, X_test, y_test)

# Step 5: Model Deployment Plan
# Deployment Plan:
# 1. Choose Deployment Platform: Deploy the model as a web service on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
# 2. Package the trained model along with necessary dependencies.
# 3. Set up the deployment environment on the chosen cloud platform.
# 4. Deploy the model as an API.
# 5. Monitor the deployed model for performance and scalability.
# 6. Prepare documentation explaining how to use the deployed model and its benefits for the e-commerce organization.

# Additional steps:
# - Hyperparameter tuning
# - Model selection (if using multiple models)
# - Model interpretation and explanation
# - Continuous monitoring and updating of the deployed model
