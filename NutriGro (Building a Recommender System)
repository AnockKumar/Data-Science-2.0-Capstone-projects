# Assuming data cleaning and preprocessing have been done as per the problem statement

# Step 3: Recommender System Development
# For simplicity, let's use a basic collaborative filtering approach

# Evaluate the recommender system using validation data

# Below is a brief documentation of the recommender system:

"""
NutriGro Recommender System Documentation:

Overview:
The NutriGro Recommender System is designed to provide personalized recipe recommendations to users based on their historical interactions with recipes. It utilizes a collaborative filtering approach to analyze user preferences and recommend recipes that are likely to be of interest to them.

Algorithm:
The recommender system employs a collaborative filtering algorithm, which analyzes user-item interactions to identify patterns and make recommendations. Specifically, it examines the recipes that users have rated highly in the past and suggests similar recipes that they may enjoy.

Usage:
To use the recommender system, users can input their unique user ID, and the system will generate a list of recommended recipes tailored to their preferences.

Performance:
The accuracy of the recommender system is evaluated using a validation dataset, measuring the proportion of correctly recommended recipes out of the total recommended recipes. The average accuracy across all users is calculated to assess the overall performance of the system.

Deployment:
The NutriGro Recommender System can be deployed on a web server or cloud platform, allowing users to access it conveniently through a user-friendly interface. The deployment process involves hosting the system on a server and ensuring its availability and scalability to accommodate user demand.
"""

# Step 6: Deployment
# The deployment of the recommender system involves setting up a web server or cloud platform to host the system. 
# Once deployed, users can access the system through a web interface or API, where they can input their user ID to receive personalized recipe recommendations.
