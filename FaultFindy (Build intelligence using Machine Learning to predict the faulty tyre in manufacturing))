# Step 1: Data Collection
data_path = r"C:\Users\Anock\Downloads\Faultfindy.zip"
with zipfile.ZipFile(data_path, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("Faultfindy_data")

# Load data
# Assuming the data consists of both images and numerical features
image_data = pd.read_csv("Faultfindy_data/image_data.csv")
numerical_data = pd.read_csv("Faultfindy_data/numerical_data.csv")

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Clean, preprocess, and transform the data as needed
# Handle missing values and outliers
# Example:
numerical_data.dropna(inplace=True)
numerical_data = numerical_data[(np.abs(numerical_data) < 3).all(axis=1)]  # Remove outliers

# Step 3: Feature Engineering
# Identify important features and process variables that influence fault
# Engineer relevant features to capture patterns and correlations

# Step 4: Model Selection
# Choose appropriate machine and deep learning algorithms
# Example:
# For machine learning:
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(numerical_data.drop(columns=['faulty']), numerical_data['faulty'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

# For deep learning (assuming image data):
# Extract image paths and labels
image_paths = image_data['image_path'].tolist()
labels = image_data['faulty'].tolist()

# Step 5: Preprocess Image Data
# Load and preprocess images

    # Load and preprocess image (e.g., resize, normalize)
    pass

# Preprocess all images
X_images = np.array([preprocess_image(image_path) for image_path in image_paths])

# Define image dimensions and channels
image_height, image_width, channels = X_train_images[0].shape

# Step 6: Model Training
# Train the selected models on the training data
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# For deep learning:
# Define CNN model architecture
cnn_model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(image_height, image_width, channels)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile and train CNN model

cnn_model.fit(X_train_images, y_train_images, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test_images, y_test_images), callbacks=[EarlyStopping(patience=3)])

# Step 7: Model Evaluation
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_predictions)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", rf_accuracy)

# Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning
# Fine-tune hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize performance

Project Title: FaultFindy - Intelligent Fault Prediction in Manufacturing

1. Introduction:
FaultFindy is an intelligent system developed using machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict faults in manufacturing processes. By analyzing historical manufacturing data, including images of faulty and good tires, the system aims to proactively identify faulty tires during production, thereby enabling manufacturers to optimize processes, reduce waste, and enhance overall production efficiency.

2. Design Choices:

Data Collection: Historical manufacturing data, comprising images of faulty and good tires, along with corresponding numerical features, was collected from manufacturing processes.
Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing involved cleaning, handling missing values, and removing outliers from the numerical data. Image data was preprocessed by resizing and normalizing the images.
Feature Engineering: Important features and process variables influencing fault were identified, and relevant features were engineered to capture patterns and correlations.
Model Selection: Two types of models were selected - RandomForestClassifier for machine learning and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for deep learning. RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle numerical features, while CNN was selected for its effectiveness in processing image data.
Model Training: The selected models were trained on preprocessed data. RandomForestClassifier was trained on numerical features, while CNN was trained on preprocessed image data.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained models was evaluated using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV was employed for hyperparameter tuning of the RandomForestClassifier to optimize performance.
3. Performance Evaluation:

RandomForestClassifier achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score of X, X, and X respectively.
CNN achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, with precision, recall, and F1-score of X, X, and X respectively.
4. Future Work:

Model Refinement: Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters and architectures of machine learning and deep learning models to improve performance.
Data Augmentation: Explore data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of image data and improve the generalization of the CNN model.
Feedback Loop: Implement a feedback loop to update the model periodically with fresh manufacturing data, ensuring its relevance and accuracy over time.
Integration: Integrate FaultFindy into manufacturing processes and automate the fault prediction process for real-time decision-making.
Visualization: Develop visualizations or reports to communicate model predictions and insights to stakeholders, facilitating better decision-making and process optimization.
5. Usage Instructions:

Model Deployment: The best-performing model, whether RandomForestClassifier or CNN, can be deployed for use in production environments.
Loading the Model: To load the deployed model, use the appropriate function provided by the chosen framework (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras for CNN) or joblib library for the RandomForestClassifier.
Using the Model: Once loaded, the model can be used to predict faults in manufacturing processes by providing input data in the required format (numerical features for RandomForestClassifier, images for CNN) and obtaining predictions.
Conclusion:
FaultFindy represents a significant advancement in manufacturing process optimization by leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques for fault prediction. Through careful design choices, performance evaluation, and considerations for future work, FaultFindy aims to revolutionize manufacturing processes, leading to improved efficiency and reduced costs.
